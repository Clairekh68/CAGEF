**Objective:** At the end of this session you will be able to use ggplot2 to make a ton of different types of plots with your data for both for data exploration and for publication-quality figures.

*Intro to the Grammar of Graphics*

-   general structure of ggplot syntax:
    -   aesthetics, geoms, scaling, statistical transformations, facetting
-   how ggplot makes use of the tidy data format

*Data Exploration - plot all the things!*

-   scatter plots, line graphs, bar graphs, histograms, density plots, bubble plots, heatmaps, strip plots
-   regression lines and error bars

*Customization of Figures*

-   attributes related to your data
    -   shapes, fill, color, opacity, size
    -   adding text to data points, labels
    -   controlling categorical variable order in your legend (forcats package)
-   color palettes (sequential, diverging, qualitative)
-   themes (attributes unrelated to your data)
    -   ie. axis, legend, panels, gridlines, backgrounds
    -   element\_text, \_line, \_rect, \_blank, \_grob
    -   designer themes
-   saving plots

*Taking it up a notch*

-   Multiple plots on one page (ie. publication images) (ggpubr)
-   Upset plots (UpSetR) as alternative to venn diagrams
-   Resources for:
    -   interactive graphics (d3heatmap, ggvis, plotly)
    -   Network diagrams (visNetwork, DiagrammR, igraph)
    -   Time series data (dygraphs)
    -   Circos plots (migest)
    -   Geospatial data (geodataviz)
    -   Phylogenetics data (ggtree, treeman, phyloseq, metacoder)
    -   Genomics data (ggbio, GenVisR, GenomeGraphs)
