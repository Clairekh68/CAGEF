#### Lesson 6 - Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, ANOVA, ANCOVA: Choosing the Best Model for the Job

**Objective:** At the end of this session you will be able to perform simple and multiple linear regression, one- and multiway analysis of variance (ANOVA) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). You will be able to interpret the statistics that come out of this model, be cognizant of the assumptions the model makes, and use an F-test to select the best model for the job.

*How we Evaluate which Model to Use*

-   How do we describe our data?
-   What hypotheses are we testing?
-   What assumptions does our model have?
-   How do we test these assumptions?
-   How do we compare models?
-   How do we interpret the output of our model?
-   How do we make a prediction for new values?

*Models we will Consider*

-   T-tests
-   Simple linear regression
-   Multiple linear regression
-   One- and Multi-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)
-   Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)

*Assumptions of general linear models*

-   normality
-   independence
-   equal variance
-   linearity

*Important considerations*

-   Dummy variables: encoding categorical variables
-   Interaction terms
-   Multiple test correction

*Resources*

-   Prediction
    -   confidence vs prediction (narrow vs wide) intervals
-   Assessing the performance of the model (feedback)
    -   Checking residuals
    -   Q-Q plots
    -   Next steps (when assumptions fail)
