###Dataset: Sequencing of the V3-V5 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA gene

16S rRNA sequencing of 30 latrines from Tanzania and Vietnam at different depths (multiples of 20cm). Microbial abundance is represented in Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) are groups of organisms defined by a specified level of DNA sequence similarity at a marker gene (e.g. 97% similarity at the V4 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene). Intrinsic environmental factors such as pH, temperature, organic matter composition were also recorded.

We have 2 csv files:

1. A metadata file (Naming conventions: [Country_LatrineNo_Depth]) with sample names and environmental variables.     
2. OTU abundance table.

Assessment of the influence of intrinsic environmental and geographical factors on the bacterial ecology of pit latrines
Microbial Biotechnology, 9(2):209-223, 2016. DOI:10.1111/1751-7915.12334

***

In this lesson we want to answer 3 simple questions: 

   
    - Which latrine depth has the greatest mean number of OTUs?
      (remember the Country_LatrineNo_Depth site encoding)
    - Is there more Clostridia in Tanzania or Vietnam?
    - Which site had the greatest number of Taxa represented?


Last lesson, we learned how to filter and select data subsets we were interested in. However, we can make data manipulation more efficient by controlling the overall structure or format of our data.

![](img/making_progress.png){width=200px} 
</br>
</br>

Let's read in our dataset, store it in a variable, and remind ourselves about the original structure.

```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(readr)

dat <- read_csv("data/SPE_pitlatrine.csv")
head(dat)

```


##Intro to tidy data

_Why tidy data?_

Data cleaning (or dealing with 'messy' data) accounts for a huge chunk of data scientist's time. Ultimately, we want to get our data into a 'tidy' format where it is easy to manipulate, model and visualize. Having a consistent data structure and tools that work with that data structure can help this process along.

Tidy data has:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

This seems pretty straight forward, and it is. It is the datasets you get that will not be straight forward. Having a map of where to take your data is helpful to unraveling its structure and getting it into a usable format.

The 5 most common problems with messy datasets are:

- common headers are values, not variable names
- multiple variables in one column
- variables stored in both rows and columns
- a single variable stored in multiple tables 
- multiple types of observational units stored in the same table

Fortunately, Hadley has also given us the tools to solve these problems.

###Intro to the tidyverse

The tidyverse is the universe of packages created by Hadley Wickham for data analysis. There are packages to help import, tidy, transform, model and visualize data. His packages are pretty popular, so he made a package to load all of his packages at once. This wrapper package is `tidyverse`. In this lesson series we have used `readr` and `readxl`, and we will be using `dplyr` and `tidyr` today, and `stringr` and `ggplot2` in future lessons. Install the package now.

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


![](img/tidyverse1.png){width=600px}

</br>
</br>

Hadley has a large fan-base. Someone even made a plot of Hadley using his own package, `ggplot2`.

Back to the normalverse...


###Assessing our data frame

Which tidy data rules might our data frame break?

At first glance we can see that the column names are actually 3 different variables: 'Country', 'LatrineNumber', and 'Depth'. This information will likely be useful in our study, as we expect different bacteria at different depths, sites, and geographical locations. Each of these is a variable and should have its own separate column.

We could keep the column names as the sample names (as they are meaningful to the researcher) and add the extra variable columns, or we could make up sample names (ie. Sample_1) knowing that the information is not being lost, but rather stored in a more useful format.

Some of the Taxa also appear to have an additional variable of information (ie. _Gp1), but not all taxa have this information. We could also make a separate column for this information.

Each result is the same observational unit (ie. relative abundances of bacteria), so having one table is fine.

###Intro to tidyr

`tidyr` is a package with functions that help us turn our 'messy' data into 'tidy' data. It has 2 major workhorse functions and 2 other tidying functions:

1. `gather()` - convert a data frame from wide to long format
2. `spread()` - convert a data frame from long to wide format
3. `separate()` - split a column into 2 or more columns based on a string separator
4. `unite()` - merge 2 or more columns into 1 column using a string separator

`gather()` and `spread()` rely on key-value pairs to collapse or expand columns.

First let's load our library. Loading `tidyverse` will include the `tidyr` package that the `gather()` function is from.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Note that 8 different packages are loaded, and that 2 functions from the `stats` package have been replaced by functions of the same name by `dplyr`. Note that you can still access the `stats` version of the function by calling it directly as `stats::filter()`. 

We can use the `gather()` function to collect our columns. This will make our dataset 'long' instead of 'wide'. 

We need to provide `gather()` with information on our new columns. The first argument is our data frame, the second argument is the __key__, which is the name for the variable we want to gather (a set of column names). In this case our columns represent latrine sites, so we can assign the name 'Sites' to our key. The next argument is the __value__, which is the name for the measurements (usually numeric or integer) we have. In this case our values are Operational Taxonomic Units, so we can assign the name 'OTUs' to our value. The third argument is all of the columns that we want to gather. You can specify the columns by listing their names or positions. 

```{r }
dat %>% gather(key = Site, value = OTUs, T_2_1:V_9_4) %>% head()
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
#equivalent to
dat %>% gather(key = Site, value = OTUs, 2:82) %>% head()
#equivalent to
dat %>% gather(Site, OTUs, -1) %>% head()
#equivalent to
dat %>% gather(Site, OTUs, -Taxa) %>% head()
```
In the above examples "-" means gather every column except the 1st, or gather every column except Taxa. Taxa would still be retained as a column but its elements are not grouped in with 'Sites' (ie. we do not want 'V_9_4', 'T_2_9', and 'Clostridia' gathered into the same column). 


Let's save the last variation into a data frame called gather_dat.

```{r}
gather_dat <- dat %>% gather(Site, OTUs, -Taxa)
```

Note how the dimensions of your dataframe have changed relative to dat. Instead of 52 rows and 82 columns, we now have a data frame with 4212 rows and 3 columns (which is the 81 columns we gathered x 52 rows). gather_dat is now in a long format instead of wide.

Next, we can use the `separate()` function to get the Country, Latrine_Number, and Depth information from our Site column. `separate()` takes in your dataframe, the name of the column to be split, the names of your new columns, and the character that you want to split the columns by (in this case an underscore). Note that the default is to remove your original column - if you want to keep it, you can add the additional argument `remove = FALSE`, keeping in mind that you now have redundant data. 

```{r eval=1}
split_dat <- gather_dat %>% separate(Site, c("Country", "Latrine_Number", "Depth"), sep = "_")
#equivalent to
split_dat <- gather_dat %>% separate(Site, c("Country", "Latrine_Number", "Depth"), sep = "_", remove = TRUE)
```

We may also want to do this for the 'Group' of Acidobacteria. Try the code, but do not save the answer in a variable.

```{r}
split_dat %>% separate(Taxa, c("Taxa", "Group"), sep = "_Gp") %>% head(20)
```

We get a warning from R that it has filled in 'NA' for the bacteria that did not have groups. Note that I chose to split Taxa using '_Gp' since I did not need 'Gp'.

__Challenge__ 


<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0" markdown="1">
![](img/pug_challenge1.jpeg){width=150px}

</div>

Use the `glimpse()` function to look  at the type of each variable in our new data frame, split_dat. Are those the types you expected? Why or why not? How is `glimpse()` different from the `str()` function?

</br>
</br>
</br>

***

```{r include = FALSE}
#Latrine_Number and Depth are characters, not numeric or integer because they were derived from a character string
#glimpse is customized for tibbles and data frames and shows as much data as possible
```


There is a useful function `group_by()` that you can use to group variables or sets of variables together. This is useful for calculations and plotting on subsets of your data without having to turn your variables into factors. Say I wanted to look at a combination of Country and Well Depth. While visually, you wouldn't notice any changes to your data frame, if you look at the structure it will now be a 'grouped_df'. There are 15 groupings resulting from Country and Depth. After I have performed my desired operation, I can return my data frame to its original structure by calling `ungroup()`. First we will examine the structure of grouped and ungrouped output without any additional operations.  

```{r}
str(split_dat)

str(split_dat %>% group_by(Country, Depth))

str(split_dat %>% group_by(Country, Depth) %>% ungroup())
```



Now we can see an example of how `group_by` in action with `summarize()`, can easily calculate summary statistics for groups of data. Whereas in our messy data frame it was difficult to do calculations based on Country, Well Number or Latrine Depth, this is now an easy task. Let's get the mean, median, standard deviation and maximum for the number of OTUs collected in Tanzania vs Vietnam.

```{r}
split_dat %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(OTUs), median = median(OTUs), sd = sd(OTUs), maximum = max(OTUs))

```

In dealing with grouped data, we no longer have to grab a Country by subsetting or using helper functions to grab letters from their names. Group by recognizes that we have 2 countries and will perform calculations for both of them.


***
Now that we have tidy data, let's answer our questions:

    - Which latrine depth has the greatest mean number of OTUs?
      (remember the Country_LatrineNo_Depth site encoding)
    - Is there more Clostridia in Tanzania or Vietnam?
    - Which site had the greatest number of Taxa represented?


__Okay, Go!__

![](img/giphy.gif){width=200px}

</br>

Which latrine depth has the greatest mean number of OTUs?


```{r}
split_dat %>% 
  group_by(Depth) %>% 
  summarize(mean = mean(OTUs)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean))

```
Without data being in 'tidy' format - with all variables that were mashed together into a Site (Country_LatrineNo_Depth)  having their own columns - this is a difficult question to answer. Once Latrine_Number is a variable, we can simply group our data to perform our mean calculation and get an answer.

Is there more Clostridia on average in sites from Tanzania or Vietnam?

```{r}
split_dat %>%
  filter(Taxa == "Clostridia") %>%
  group_by(Country) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(OTUs)) %>%
  arrange(desc(mean))

```
Again, being able to filter by Taxa and group by Country (as an isolated variable) helps a lot. With `dplyr` syntax we can perform all data manipulations and calculations in a code block that is readable. 


Which site had the greatest number of Taxa represented? 

```{r}
split_dat %>% 
  group_by(Country, Latrine_Number, Depth) %>% 
  filter(OTUs != 0) %>%
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(count))

```

Since we can group by the 3 variables that were in the Site name, there is no disadvantage to having our data in tidy format compared to our original wide data frame. However now we are able to filter for non-zero OTUs, which was impossible in the wide format. Since we know from earlier in the lesson that each Taxa is only represented once for each site, we only have to count and order the number of observations to get our answer.

To get data back into its original format, there are reciprocal functions in the tidyr package, making it possible to switch between wide and long formats. 

__Fair question:__ But you've just been telling me how great the 'long' format is?!?! Why would I want the wide format again???

__Honest answer:__ Note that our original data frame was 52 rows and expanded to 4212 rows in the long format. When you have, say, a genomics dataset you might end up with 6,000 rows expanding to 600,000 rows. You probably want to do your calculations and switch back to the more 'human readable' format. Sure, I can save a data frame with 600,000 rows, but I can't really send it to anyone because LibreOffice or Excel might crash opening it.

gap <- gap %>% separate(obs_type, c("obs_type", "year"), sep="_", convert = TRUE)

gap <- gap %>% spread(key = obs_type, value = obs_value)

gap <- gap %>% select(continent, country, year, lifeExp, pop, gdpPercap)

nrow(gap)
```

##Adding rows and columns to data frames

We are going to use a subset of the collected environmental data from the study to practice adding rows and columns to a data frame. We can use our pipe while reading in our data to do this subsetting.

```{r}
jdat <- read_csv("data/ENV_pitlatrine.csv") %>% select(1:4)

glimpse(jdat)
```

There is a function from `dplyr`, `bind_rows()`, which tries to save you from human error when joining a row of observations to a data frame by ensuring that your column names match (so data is not entered in the wrong column). If you do not give column names, an error will be thrown.

What data structure should you be using to add a row to a data frame?

If you give `bind_rows()` the correct column information in vector format, it will only add a vector as a row IF THE CHARACTER TYPE MATCHES ALL DATA FRAME COLUMN TYPES (ie. if our data frame was all character data). Otherwise, it actually gives you the useful error that your character types are not matching. 

```{r error = TRUE}
bind_rows(jdat, c(Samples = "V_2_10", pH = 6, Temp = 5, TS = 5)) %>% tail()
```

A list allows us to add the data we can't add in vector format, by retaining the data types that match the data frame columns.

```{r}
bind_rows(jdat, list(Samples = "V_2_10", pH = 6, Temp = 5, TS = 5)) %>% tail()

```

If you give `bind_rows()` the correct column information in list format, it will add your row. 

A _sanity check_ is making sure things are turning out as you expect them to - it is a way of checking your (or others') assumptions. It is particularly useful in the data exploration stage when you are getting familiar with your data set before you try to run any type of model. However, it is also good to make sure a function is behaving as you expect it to, or trouble-shooting odd behaviours

Here is a sanity check on switching the order of the columns.

```{r}
bind_rows(jdat, list(Samples = "V_2_10", Temp = 5, pH = 6, TS = 5)) %>% tail()
```

Since we have named our values, `bind_rows()` will add the value to the appropriate column. 


What happens if column name do not match? `bind_rows()` will match your columns as much as possible, and then create new columns for the data that does not fit at the end of your data frame. Note that 'NA's will be created for all missing data.

```{r error = TRUE}
bind_rows(jdat, list(Turtles = "V_2_10", pH = 5, Volatility = 5, TS = 5)) %>% tail()
```

You can also bind data frames together, which is another common use of this function.

```{r}
bind_rows(jdat, data.frame(Samples = "V_2_10", pH = 5, Temp = 5, TS = 5, stringsAsFactors = F)) %>% tail()

```



__Socrative Question__


***

<div style="float:left;margin:0 10px 10px 0" markdown="1">
![](img/pause.jpg){width=100px}

</div>
Why doesn't jdat change after all these operations?

</br>

</br>

```{r include=FALSE}
#This is just a reminder that if you want to retain the addition of a row from 'bind_rows' you need to save it into a variable. You can reassign the data frame object that you have (jdat) or create a new data frame object.
#ie. new_dat <- bind_rows(jdat, list(Samples = "V_2_10", Temp = 5, pH = 6, TS = 5))
```


***



Whenever you are adding rows or columns, I strongly advise checking to see that the dimensions of the resulting data frame are what you expect. 
```{r}
jdat <- bind_rows(jdat, list(Samples = "V_2_10", pH = 6, Temp = 5, TS = 5)) 
dim(jdat)
```

1. Which race speaks the most? Is this true across all 3 films?
1. Which character is chattiest?
1. Which gender speaks the most for Elvish characters? Does this hold true across all 3 films?
1. Which Characters are these elves likely to be?

##All of the joins

Often we have more than one data table that shares a common attribute. For example, with our current dataset, we have other variables (such as pH) for a sample, as well as our OTU table, both of which have site IDs (ie. T_2_9). We want to merge these into one table.


Joins can be tricky, so we are going to use a subset of our tidy data such that we can easily observe the output of our join.

Joins use a 'key' by which we can match up our data frames. When we look at our data frames we can see that they have matching information in 'Samples'.  We are going to reduce our dataset by only keeping non-zero values so we can see how the join functions work a bit more easily.

Filter unite_dat to remove all non-zero values, and store it in an object ndat. How many rows in unite_dat had the value of zero? Sort ndat to keep the top 20 rows with the highest OTUs.

</br>
</br>
</br>

***

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

ndat <- unite_dat %>% filter(OTUs!=0) %>% arrange(desc(OTUs)) %>% .[1:20, ]
```

We will remove some observations from jdat, just so our key columns don't match perfectly.

```{r}
jdat <- jdat[-c(4,7,9,12,20,22) , 1:4]

```

As a starting point for the next exercise ndat has 20 rows and 3 columns, and jdat has 76 rows and 4 columns.


There are 2 types of joins:

1. _mutating joins_ - uses a key to match observations and combines variables from 2 tables (adding columns and potentially rows)
2. _filtering joins_ - uses a key to match observations, to subset observations (rows)

In these examples we are joining 2 dataframes: x and y.

__Inner join__ is a mutating join.  Inner join returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combination of the matches are returned.

A set of graphics from _'R for Data Science'_ makes the description clearer:
![img borrowed from r4ds.had.co.nz](img/join-inner.png){width=500px}  


```{r}

inner_join(ndat, jdat, by = c("Site" = "Samples"))

```

We have 6 columns in the resulting data frame - all columns minus the 'Samples' column which was a duplicated id column (equal to ndat's 'Site' column). We can see that there are 18 rows in the resulting data frame. Rows from ndat that did not have a matching site in jdat were removed.

</br>

__Outer joins__ are a set of mutating joins. There are 3 outer joins: left, right, and full.


![img borrowed from r4ds.had.co.nz](img/join-outer.png){width=500px}
</br>
</br>


__Left join__ returns all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned.


```{r}

left_join(ndat, jdat, by = c("Site" = "Samples"))

```
That means that we will have our 20 rows from ndat and 6 columns; any Sites that weren't found in jdat (in this case T_2_2 and T_4_3) will be filled with NA.

__Right join__ returns all rows from y, and all columns from x and y. Rows in y with no match in x will have NA values in the new columns. If there are multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned.

```{r}

right_join(ndat, jdat, by = c("Site" = "Samples"))

```

That means that we will have our 76 rows from jdat, and any items that weren't found in ndat will be filled with NA. Since there are 77 rows in the final data frame, this means there must have been multiple rows matching from ndat. In other words, we had a duplicate key (Site) in ndat. Again, we have 6 columns.

</br>


![img borrowed from r4ds.had.co.nz](img/join-one-to-many.png){width=500px}

</br>

</br>

Let's try to find which Site was duplicated by using `n()`.

```{r}
right_join(ndat, jdat, by = c("Site" = "Samples")) %>% 
  group_by(Site) %>% 
  filter(n()>1)

```

Note that Bacteriodia and Clostridia have different OTUs (from ndat), but the same pH, Temp and TS (from jdat). 


</br>

![img borrowed from r4ds.had.co.nz](img/join-many-to-many.png){width=500px}

</br>

__Full join__ returns all rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there are not matching values, NAs are filled in for missing values.


```{r}

full_join(ndat, jdat, by = c("Site" = "Samples"))

```
The full join returns all of the rows from both ndat and jdat as well as the 6 columns - we have the 75 rows from jdat, plus the second V_17_1 as seen in the right_join and T_2_2 and T_4_3 that we present in ndat but NA in jdat for a total of 79 rows.

Lastly, we have the 2 filtering joins. These will not add columns, but rather filter the rows based on what is present in the second data frame.

__Semi join__ returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, keeping just columns from x. A semi join differs from an inner join because an inner join will return one row of x for each matching row of y, where a semi join will never duplicate rows of x.

```{r}
semi_join(ndat, jdat, by = c("Site" = "Samples"))

```
`semi_join()` returns the 18 rows of ndat that have a Site match in jdat. Note that we have 3 columns; the columns from jdat have not been added.

It is easier to see the effect of semi-join by switching the order of our data frame input (ie. `semi_join(jdat, ndat, by = c("Samples" = "Site"))`). How many rows and columns do you expect in this output?

</br>

__Anti join__ returns all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, keeping just columns from x.

```{r}
anti_join(ndat, jdat, by = c("Site" = "Samples"))

```
This returns our 2 rows in ndat that did not have a match in jdat. Again, we have 3 columns; the columns from jdat have not been added.

Given the definitions for the inner_, left_, right_, full_, semi_ and anti_joins, what would you expect the resulting data frame to be if jdat and ndat were reversed? Write down the number of rows and columns you would expect the data frame to have, then run the code. Did you find any surprises?


```{r include = FALSE}
inner_join(jdat, ndat, by = c("Samples" = "Site"))
#18 rows, 6 columns - note order - Samples column is returned instead of Site column
left_join(jdat, ndat, by = c("Samples" = "Site"))
#77 rows, 6 columns
right_join(jdat, ndat, by = c("Samples" = "Site"))
#20 rows, 6 columns
full_join(jdat, ndat, by = c("Samples" = "Site"))
#79 rows, 6 columns as above
semi_join(jdat, ndat, by = c("Samples" = "Site"))
#17 rows (V_17_1 not duplicated), 4 columns
anti_join(jdat, ndat, by = c("Samples" = "Site"))
#59 rows, 4 columns - 18 rows of ndat have a match in jdat, but one has a site duplication (76-17 = 59)

```
