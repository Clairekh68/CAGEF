CAGEF Training & Outreach Material by Erica Acton (erica.acton@utoronto.ca)


This repository is part of the Centre for the Analysis of Genome Evolution & Function's (CAGEF) bioinformatics training initiative. These courses and workshops were developed based on feedback of the needs and interests of the Department of Cell & Systems Biology and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto.

## Course Information


#### Coordinators

Professor D. Guttman and Erica Acton

#### Offered

Fall 2018 - September 18 - October 23 (6 weeks)

#### Weight

One module (0.25 FCE)

#### Time

Tuesdays, 3:00 - 6:00pm

#### Location

St. George Campus, Earth Sciences Centre, Rm 3087

#### Description

This course is a beginner’s introduction to R and R-Studio for students who do not have a computer science background. It is intended for the student who wants to develop the skills to analyze his or her own data. Students who complete this course will be able to 1) be comfortable with the R-Studio environment, data structures and data types, 2) import data into R and manipulate data frames, 3) transform a ‘messy’ dataset into a ‘tidy’ dataset, 4) make exploratory plots, 5) use string manipulation to clean data, and 6) perform basic statistical tests and run a regression model. The structure of the class is ‘code-along’ and students are expected to bring a laptop. 

#### Evaluation

Grades in this module will be determined by a combination of participation in in-class quizzes (6 x 5% = 30%), short assignments (5 x 10% = 50%), and a final project (20%). Short assignments require students to apply the material that they learned during each module with an emphasis on well-documented code that is concise. The final project brings together concepts from all modules by performing exploratory data analysis on a dataset of interest.


#### Pre-requisites

Access to a laptop computer at each module that can connect to the internet.; 2) R and R-Studio installed (https://cloud.r-project.org/ and https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). There will be some challenge questions as well as multiple choice questions on Socrative; a class key will be provided in class. 

#### Reading materials

As preparatory material for the course, students should install swirl (install.packages(‘swirl’)) and complete R Programming 1: Basic Building Blocks, 3: Sequences of Numbers, 4: Vectors, 7: Matrices and Data Frames. A reference throughout the course will be R for Data Science (http://r4ds.had.co.nz/).

#### Website

All lesson materials and datasets for the course are found at https://github.com/eacton/CAGEF. Assignments will be submitted to a course Dropbox.
